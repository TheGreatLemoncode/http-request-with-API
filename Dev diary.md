1. Today i'm training to become a better programmer.
I realised that only doing school work and just 
getting very average is not ok. I was conditioning
myself to work under someone feeding me orders and
i can't stand it. I realised that im someone that 
think alot. And sometimes, and think of how some 
systems actually work or how some things can be done. 
So i decided that i will put in code every idea that
come in my head and develop it until it's a full fledge
system that i can post for other to use. I'm nowhere near
a genius so it me take me some time to finish some ideas
so bear with me.

That was today entry from your new friend Lemon from HiLemonCode (Dec 29 2025)


2. I'm in the second phase of the challenge. I can connect
to an API using http requests. I'm now building teh GUI to
allow the users to identify or register to my database. the 
will be in plain text for now. At the end i will hash the
password and mails. Let's stop for today, my babies won't
let me concentrate. 

today was kind of lacking sorry. From your trusted friend the great Lemon (Dec 30 2025)
