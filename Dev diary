Today i'm training to become a better programmer.
I realised that only doing school work and just 
getting very average is not ok. I was conditioning
myself to work under someone feeding me orders and
i can't stand it. I realised that im someone that 
think alot. And sometimes, and think of how some 
systems actually work or how some things can be done. 
So i decided that i will put in code every idea that
come in my head and develop it until it's a full fledge
system that i can post for other to use. I'm nowhere near
a genius so it me take me some time to finish some ideas
so bear with me.
